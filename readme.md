# Software-Based Data Recovery – Case Log
Operated by **Sherry** — Software-only HDD data recovery practice log.

This repository documents real recovery attempts, anonymized and written for technical clarity.
All work follows a read-only, imaging-first workflow. No client data is ever uploaded here.

## What This Repo Contains
• Case summaries  
• ddrescue raw mapfiles  
• SMART dumps  
• Disk identity fingerprints  
• Notes on filesystem behavior and failure patterns  

## What This Repo Never Contains
✘ Actual recovered files  
✘ Real filenames  
✘ Personal or sensitive information  
✘ Photos, videos, documents, directory listings

## Workflow Philosophy
1️⃣ Image first — never touch the original  
2️⃣ Preserve — never modify evidence  
3️⃣ Recover only after imaging  
4️⃣ Stop early if risk > value  
5️⃣ Document so judgment compounds

## Why This Exists
This repo is a long-term record to:
• Track experience  
• Build professional identity  
• Demonstrate forensic-grade authenticity  
• Become accountable to the craft, not outcomes

---

> Early-stage practice. Expect imperfection — and progress.
