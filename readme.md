# Software-Based Data Recovery – Case Log
Operated by **Sherry** — Software-only HDD data recovery practice log.

This repository documents real recovery attempts, anonymized and written for technical clarity.
All work follows a read-only, imaging-first workflow. No client data is ever uploaded here.

## What This Repo Contains
• Case summaries  
• ddrescue raw mapfiles  
• SMART dumps  
• Disk identity fingerprints  
• Notes on filesystem behavior and failure patterns  

## What This Repo Never Contains
✘ Actual recovered files  
✘ Personally identifiable directory names  
✘ User photos, videos, or documents  
✘ Screenshots exposing private folder names or file previews  

✔ Only anonymized / cropped / non-sensitive evidence may be shown  
(to demonstrate authenticity without breaching privacy)

## Workflow Philosophy
1️⃣ Image first — never touch the original  
   (*Exception: if drive is mechanically healthy and only logically corrupted, 
   a non-destructive scan with TestDisk / DMDE may be run to evaluate recoverability before imaging. 
   No write operations without a backup or client consent.*) 
   
2️⃣ Preserve — never modify evidence  
3️⃣ Recover only after imaging  
4️⃣ Stop early if risk > value  
5️⃣ Document so judgment compounds

## Why This Exists
This repo is a long-term record to:
• Track experience  
• Build professional identity  
• Demonstrate forensic-grade authenticity  
• Become accountable to the craft, not outcomes

## All cases are documented with client consent.  
## No client-identifiable content is uploaded.  
## Images are cropped to avoid revealing personal folder names or files.
